Within `./URLValidatorInCorrect`:

Changes detailed below:
1. `testManualTest` method performs manual testing of 10 URLs, 5 valid and 5 invalid. Failing test cases are commented out. 11th test case was added to debug a unit test case.
2. `testFirstParition`, `testSecondPartition`, `testThirdPartition`, and `testFourthPartition` contain partitions of possible URLs.
3. `testIsValid` contains programmatic unit-tests for the `isValid` method in `UrlValidator.java`.
